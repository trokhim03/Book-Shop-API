## üõ†Ô∏è Setting up a project

There are two ways to launch a project:

- **Local run** - for those who want to work with their own database.

- **Launching via Docker** (recommended) - automatic deployment of all components.

## üíª Local run
1Ô∏è‚É£ **Clone the Repository**

  First, clone the repository to your local machine:
  
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/trokhim03/BookShop-API.git
  ```
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Build the Project**
  
  Use Maven to clean and package the project:
  ```bash
  mvn clean package
  ```
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Edit application.properties**

Configure your database connection and application settings by editing the ``` src/main/resources/application.properties ``` file.

**Example application.properties File**

``` properties
# Database Configuration
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://<YOUR_DB_HOST>:<YOUR_DB_PORT>/<YOUR_DB_NAME>
spring.datasource.username=<YOUR_DB_USERNAME>
spring.datasource.password=<YOUR_DB_PASSWORD>
spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver

# Hibernate settings
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=validate
spring.jpa.show-sql=true

# JWT Configuration
jwt.expiration=<TIME_SESSION_EXPIRATION_IN_MS>
jwt.secret=<SECRET_WORD>
```
4Ô∏è‚É£ **Start the Application**

Run the Spring Boot application:
```
mvn spring-boot:run
```

The application will be available at http://localhost:8080 (default port)

## üê≥ Launching via Docker

If you want Docker to automatically deploy the database and application:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Create an .env file in the project root with the following variables:**

```ini
# MySQL root user credentials (for initialization only)
MYSQLDB_ROOT_PASSWORD= ******** # Replace with strong password

# Application database settings
MYSQLDB_DATABASE=book_shop          # Database name
MYSQLDB_USER=bookshop_user          # Application database username
MYSQLDB_PASSWORD= ******** # Application database password

# Network ports configuration
MYSQLDB_LOCAL_PORT=5434             # MySQL port mapping for local development
SPRING_LOCAL_PORT=8088              # Spring application port for local development
SPRING_DOCKER_PORT=8080             # Spring application port in container

# Remote debugging port (for IDE integration)
DEBUG_PORT=5005                     # Java debug port
```

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Start the containers:**
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

The application will then be available at http://localhost:8088
